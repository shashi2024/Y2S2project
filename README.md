# Hotel Management System

The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify the process of managing a hotel. It provides a user-friendly interface for handling tasks such as booking rooms, managing reservations, billing, and other administrative tasks.

This system is built using the MERN stack, a powerful combination of technologies including MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single page applications where you need a fast, interactive user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building fast and scalable network applications.

The MERN stack allows for a seamless process from front-end to back-end development, making the Hotel Management System efficient, reliable, and easy to use.
